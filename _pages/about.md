I'm a DevOps/Cloud Engineer and an AWS certified Developer - Associate and Solutions Architect - Associate. I have 8 years of experience in IT, with a focus around AWS,Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, Infrastructure-as-Code, and Automation. I'm currently living in Houston, Texas with my fianc√©e and our two cats.

I'm currently the DevOps Lead for Travisoft, a provider of health benefits administration software. Usually my days consist of improving our AWS environment and CI/CD pipelines, as well as making sure we're staying compliant with security requirements.

When I'm not working or trying to stay on top of the latest tech, I'm usually geeking out about video games/anime or tinkering with some side project.

I love talking about tech; things like new ideas, concepts, and better ways of doing things. That's also the reason I made this site, hoping that I might be able to help a few more people with my rambling!
If you have any questions on anything, feel free to shoot me an email.
